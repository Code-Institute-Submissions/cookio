### Collaborative Recipe Book

Mongocho is a “Just for fun" website created to offer cartoon and illustration enthusiasts a gallery updated weekly with copyright free drawings and graphic gags.

The site is planned and built to showcase some of my work, to have fun and to connect with an audience that will appreciate my kind of humour to hopefully engage in a conversation.

The website is not intended to be an exhaustive portfolio of my work but a creative exercise to show a limited number of drawings and cartoons in the gallery which I am planning to update weekly with new material.

The main feature is a memory game where I show some of my characters in pairs to be matched in the least possible number of moves.

## User Experience

### UX

This website has been designed as a multi-page front end website with parallax on scrolling.

The website shows at first the logo and a tagline, nav bar and sample of the drawings on parallax.
There is a section with a short introduction to what MOngocho is about and a footer with subscribe section and social media links.

There are several hover effects in the footer, over the titles and in social media icons.

The Contact Us section is a form with "required fields" and drop down menu to select style of painting desired.

### Using the website

- The visitor will see the Landing Page with the logo on top and a tagline.
- A NavBar provides an easy way to select the desired section and sticks to the top when scrolling down.
- A first cartoon appears and gives a 3D effect (Parallax) when scrolling) giving way to text explaining who I am.
- A new cartoon appears and, again, a text section appears with an explanation of how I create my drawings.
- A third cartoon is revealed before reaching the footer.

### The Gallery

- The next page is a gallery with a selection of cartoons and drawings. This gallery displays in a modal with easy navigation in carrousel or in group with easy browsing.

### The Memory Game

- The memory game is a 4 x 4 card grid with back logo and 8 pair of cartoons (4 Female and 4 Male).
- I got inspiration and guidance from Marina Ferreira (Credited) but I have modified the game with my own design with new styling, number of cards and functionality.
- I added a Restart Button and a counter to make it more engaging and fun to play.
